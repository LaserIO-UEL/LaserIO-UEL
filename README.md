# LaserIO Unofficial Extended Life
A fork of LaserIO which aims to:
- Add new features
- Support the 1.20.1 version of LaserIO
- Cleanup and optimize

As Direwolf20, the creator of LaserIO, said: "Can't have DireWire without Wires!"... We think?

# Basic Features:
- Chemical Cards for use with Mekanism gasses (if Mekanism is installed)
- Energy Cards max FE/t is now configurable via config (default: 1,000,000 FE/t)
- Removal of standard Overclockers from Energy Cards
- Show particles button inside Nodes
- Updated guide book

# Advanced Features:
- Optional Energy Overclocker tier(s) meant to help pack developers better gate energy transportation
- These tiers come with: configurable names, max energy values (tooltips will change to reflect these values), and colors - all controllable from the config!
- Automatic maximum extract value on Overclocker insert
- General cleanup and optimizations

# Migration:
Even if this fork adds a lot of new and cool features, don't worry: migration from LaserIO to LaserIO-UEL is safe!<br/>
Existing blocks and items will not disappear, for the most part (only Overclockers contained inside Energy Cards will).<br/>
**To be safe, before loading into your main save file, remember to backup it!**

# Future Plans:
- Node cloning
- Tick settings related to Logistic Overclockers configurable from config
